Terminology Service
=======

Overview
--------

For the access of hetrogenous terminological content from common platform we have developed a UTS (Unified Terminology Service) model using CTS2 (HL7 standard) and SKOS. We have CTS2 conceptual model over the SKOS model. Some of the properties were directly mapped over SKOS, but some properties of CTS2 were added as an extension of SKOS. The UTS model is shown in figure below
